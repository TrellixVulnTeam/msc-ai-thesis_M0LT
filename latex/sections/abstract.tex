Personalized interaction between users and dialogue systems is crucial to obtain systems that are trusted by users and perceived as natural.
Because a person's use of language is known to change with age, personalized dialogue systems should be able to identify a user's age profile, and then generate age-adaptive responses, based on the identified signal.
% Developing a module that first automatically identifies a user's age profile, and another module that then adapts the generated text output to the identified signal, are essential steps to obtaining .

Recently, the development of Plug-and-Play language models (PPLM) has led to computationally relatively inexpensive methods to control the writing style of text outputs generated by large pre-trained Transformer-based language models.
However, their application to enforce abstract writing styles (like age-related language) on dialogue responses is virtually unexplored.
This thesis therefore aims to study the detection and subsequent generation of age-related linguistic features in dialogue settings.
First, I investigate to what extent various purely text-based NLP models can detect age-related linguistic patterns in dialogue.
It is found that a fine-tuned BERT-model is able to distinguish between transcribed dialogue utterances of different age groups with reasonable accuracy. 
At the same time, much simpler models based on $n$-grams can do so with comparable performance, which suggests that, in dialogue, "local" features can be indicative of the language of speakers from different age groups.
The presumed locality of age-indicative features identified during age-detection motivates the use of both simple bag-of-words (BoW) attribute models, in addition to more sophisticated neural discriminator attribute models for controlled dialogue generation using PPLM.
The results show that age-adaptive dialogue generation with PPLM is possible to the extent that my text-based classifiers can reliably detect age-related linguistic patterns.
% that age-related linguistic features are detectable by my classifiers.
Furthermore, it is observed that discriminator-based PPLM-setups achieve higher levels of detectable control than BoW-based setups but generate significantly more perplexing and repetitive responses.
I also carry out extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing the effects of prompt-induced biases and the presence of previously studied age-related linguistic patterns in dialogue responses generated by PPLM-setups.
I conclude that both structural and local features should be taken into account when adapting the output of dialogue generation models to certain age groups.
Overall, I believe this work is a promising step towards the development of personalized dialogue systems.
